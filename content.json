In the first time, I have tried to learning the math by reading the textbook one page by one page. It works well when I was reading the 1st and 2nd chapter. But after the subject is deeply dived, the reading speed become very slowly. In addition, I cannot even understand the content by paragraphs. I become more sensitive to the every new statement that has never been memtioned in the foregoing paragraphs and tried to prove them in my language. Also, only reading books make me ignorant of the big picture of the knowledge system, and get trapped in the local conclusion. Fortunately, I have found good methed to learn math effectively. I called it Onion Peeling method. After much endeavour, I have realized that I cannot go straight through the subject only by reading the textbook. I should learning the math course more than twice. The first stage is to lesson to the video lecture. I must pause the video until I have under stand all the frame in the video. With the lecture taught by the teacher, it helps me keep a proper pace with the input of the knowledge and introduce the backbone part of the course. The second stage is to finish the assignment, important ones rather than quantity. The purpose of this stage is not to thoroughly learn the course, but to understand the video. It gives me a mind cue to show I have open the course door and reach the new start point. The second stage is to carefully read the subsection and finish the exercises keeping me the attraction. Don’t forget to forgive yourself if you give up the hardcore content. It does not mean you are a deserter but just withdrawing for the next attack. The whole process is similar to peel the onion skin. About music learningThis is the third week that I attend MOOC of the music theory. I know that the learning intensity is not very high. But as a beginner, it would cost me a lot time to be accustomed to the strange symbol. I would tried to repeat more than 5 times, 3 times in Chinese and 2 times in English. I cannot resist to such a lesson that if I want to learn a new lesson, mannual handwriting is indispensable for learning in a acceptable speed. The impatience is a truly enemy for learning About the summaryThis is my routine summary. I plan to update it monthly or weekly in my leisure time. The topic is not limited, but many of the most content will be about my life and work. It is also a good tools to help me deposit in my real life and protect me from illusion. Some interesting thing during my writingI found some synonym of the world attack and impatience.Impatinent: irritableattack: assault, offenseI don’t want to get into the usage of words seriously. In this summary, I just want to use simple word to describe my routines clearly. It is not a form of showing off my vocabulary. Compared with the usage of some fashionable word, I am more interested in take good advantange of the common words. Only when I have to take difference for some ambiguous concepts, I would use more advanced words in GRE.","categories":[{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Summary/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Daily Summary","slug":"Daily-Summary","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Daily-Summary/"}]},{"title":"Camera Calibration","slug":"camera-calibration","date":"2023-08-28T11:14:00.000Z","updated":"2023-08-27T13:33:28.930Z","comments":true,"path":"2023/08/28/camera-calibration/","link":"","permalink":"http://example.com/2023/08/28/camera-calibration/","excerpt":"","text":"Motivation I have found that there have been some difference of calibrating result. The calibrated optical center from the same camera of one calibration algorithm varies about 5-7 pixels. In the following article, this problem is called &quot;the optical center pesudo-displacement problem&quot;. In addition, I also found that the calibrating result is not robust with respect to the slight difference of camera placement. From an intuitive view, I think the common difference of optical center is in 0.5 pixels. I think there is a large optimization space to improve the calibration algorithm. Corner detection of the Chessboard Corner Point Detection is the first step to detect corner points on the image. The chessboard is placed in front of camera. All the corner points are projected into the pixel plane, which is denoted as {xi,yi}\\{x_i, y_i\\}{xi​,yi​}. The experiment environment includes two schemes of the chessboard placement.

This is a series to learning functional analysis. I will writing all my thinking during the learning of function analysis. I am not a math amateur. The reason that I want to learn functional analysis is that I have some tough optimization problems that must be overcome by this kind of mathematical tool. My article is updated in append mode, which means I will append all the content about Chapter 2 in this article rather than write a new article. The reference book for this article is &lt;Linear and Nonlinear Functional Analysis with Applications&gt; and &lt;Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications&gt;. I know it is difficult for me to read all of this book. I am not meant to read all the book in one turn. I just read once, writing down all of the important things of my feelings. It is a introductive reading, a mixing of 75% linear reading and 20% repeatly reading at first, and then 100% repealy reading. The key to learning such textbook is slow and careful! Chapter 1 SetSet -&gt; Relationship(mapping) -&gt; Function Set consist of many point.When we have two set, two set then have Relationship, which add some “edges” to the set Some Concept about SetsEquivalence Relation: reftexivity, symmetry, transitivity. Such 3 conditions gurantee provide a “similar” or “equal” testing criterion of $\\mathcal{R_1} &#x3D; \\mathcal{R_2}$ Tips：A Equivanlence Relation may include many isolated “sub” equivanlence relations.Two equivalence classes of elements of X are thus either identical(equal) or disjoint(similar). For example, for a modulo operator with the same residue, ${(1,1), (4,1), (7,4)…} \\cup {(2,2), (5,2), (8,5)…}$ $\\mathcal{P}(X)$: elements are all the subsets of X. A Equivalence Class of $x$ modulo $\\mathcal{R}$: given a $x \\in X$, the subset of X defined by$$ \\dot{x}:&#x3D;{y\\in X; y \\sim x}$$where $y \\sim x$ means $(y,x) \\in \\mathcal{R}$ Quotient Set $X&#x2F;\\mathcal{R}$: the subset of $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ consisting of all equivalence classes modulo$\\mathcal{R}$ of elements of X. Cardinal NumbersHow to count a set with inifinite elements? Such as the number of rational numbers and irational numbers. Given a relation $\\mathcal{R}$, which means “there exists a bijection of $A$ onto $B$”, where $A$ and $B$ are the subsets of $X$. Such a relation is a equivalence relation $\\mathcal{R}$ on set $\\mathcal{P}.$ The elements of quotient set $\\mathcal{P}(X)&#x2F;R \\subset \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(X))$ are called cardinal numbers of the subsets of $X$. If $A$ is the subset of $X$, its caridnal number, denoted as$$card A$$ We can know cardinal number is not a number like $\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$. It just pick out all the subset of $X$ with the same “size”. Chapter 2 Normed Vector SpaceVector SpaceA set $X$ is called a vector space over $\\mathbb{K}$ when it support addition or scalar(complex or real) multiplication. A subspace of a vector space is any subset of $X$ that is also a vector space. A direct sum of subspace $Y,Z$ of space $X$ if any $x \\in X $ can be written down as$$ x &#x3D; y+z \\ \\ with\\ \\ y\\in Y \\ and\\ z \\in Z$$ Example of Vector Space$Span \\ A$： Subspace Spanned by a subset $A$ of $X$Let we think more about what does it mean?let we add more hidden symbols left out. A vector space $S$ spanned by a subset $A$ of $X$ is a subspace of $X$. It is consisting of all finite linear combination of vectors of A, i.e., any vector $x \\in X$ of the form $x &#x3D; \\sum_{j\\in J}{\\alpha_j a_j}$, where the set $J$ of indices is finite, and $\\alpha_j \\in \\mathbb{K}$ and $a_j \\in A$ for all $j \\in j$. The first half sentence tells us how to write down a finite linear combination. The second half of the sentense after where ... tells us how to express the formulation in language. Such subspace is denote as: $$ Span\\ A$$ Hamel Basisa Hamel Basis in X is any family (aka. a set of) $(e_i)_{i \\in I}$ of vectors $e_i \\in X$ satisfing two properties: linearly independent. $\\sum_{j \\in J}{\\alpha_je_j&#x3D;0} &#x3D;&gt; \\alpha_j &#x3D; 0$ $Span \\ (e_i)_{i \\in I} &#x3D; X$ Example, the family $(e_n)^{\\infty}_{n&#x3D;0}$, where $e_n(x)&#x3D;x^n, x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, constitutes a Hamel basis in the space of all polynomials of one real variable. Theorem 2.1-1Let $X \\neq {0}$ be a vector space THere exists a Hamel basis of X Let $E$ and $F be two Hamel Bases of $X$ Then, $card\\ E&#x3D;card\\ F$ Chapter 3 Banach SpaceBanach spaces, i.e. , complete normed vector spaces, play a central role in linear and nonlinearfunctional analysis.","categories":[{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Math/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Funtional Analysis","slug":"Funtional-Analysis","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Funtional-Analysis/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Summary/"},{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Math/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Daily Summary","slug":"Daily-Summary","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Daily-Summary/"},{"name":"Robotics","slug":"Robotics","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Robotics/"},{"name":"Funtional Analysis","slug":"Funtional-Analysis","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Funtional-Analysis/"}]}
