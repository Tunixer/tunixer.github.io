This is a series to learning functional analysis. I will writing all my thinking during the learning of function analysis. I am not a math amateur. The reason that I want to learn functional analysis is that I have some tough optimization problems that must be overcome by this kind of mathematical tool. My article is updated in append mode, which means I will append all the content about Chapter 2 in this article rather than write a new article. The reference book for this article is &lt;Linear and Nonlinear Functional Analysis with Applications&gt; and &lt;Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications&gt;. I know it is difficult for me to read all of this book. I am not meant to read all the book in one turn. I just read once, writing down all of the important things of my feelings. It is a introductive reading, a mixing of 75% linear reading and 20% repeatly reading at first, and then 100% repealy reading. The key to learning such textbook is slow and careful! Chapter 1 SetSet -&gt; Relationship(mapping) -&gt; Function Set consist of many point.When we have two set, two set then have Relationship, which add some “edges” to the set Some Concept about SetsEquivalence Relation: reftexivity, symmetry, transitivity. Such 3 conditions gurantee provide a “similar” or “equal” testing criterion of $\\mathcal{R_1} &#x3D; \\mathcal{R_2}$ Tips：A Equivanlence Relation may include many isolated “sub” equivanlence relations.Two equivalence classes of elements of X are thus either identical(equal) or disjoint(similar). For example, for a modulo operator with the same residue, ${(1,1), (4,1), (7,4)…} \\cup {(2,2), (5,2), (8,5)…}$ $\\mathcal{P}(X)$: elements are all the subsets of X. A Equivalence Class of $x$ modulo $\\mathcal{R}$: given a $x \\in X$, the subset of X defined by$$ \\dot{x}:&#x3D;{y\\in X; y \\sim x}$$where $y \\sim x$ means $(y,x) \\in \\mathcal{R}$ Quotient Set $X&#x2F;\\mathcal{R}$: the subset of $\\mathcal{P}(X)$ consisting of all equivalence classes modulo$\\mathcal{R}$ of elements of X. Cardinal NumbersHow to count a set with inifinite elements? Such as the number of rational numbers and irational numbers. Given a relation $\\mathcal{R}$, which means “there exists a bijection of $A$ onto $B$”, where $A$ and $B$ are the subsets of $X$. Such a relation is a equivalence relation $\\mathcal{R}$ on set $\\mathcal{P}.$ The elements of quotient set $\\mathcal{P}(X)&#x2F;R \\subset \\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{P}(X))$ are called cardinal numbers of the subsets of $X$. If $A$ is the subset of $X$, its caridnal number, denoted as$$card A$$ We can know cardinal number is not a number like $\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{R}$ and $\\mathbb{C}$. It just pick out all the subset of $X$ with the same “size”. Chapter 2 Normed Vector SpaceVector SpaceA set $X$ is called a vector space over $\\mathbb{K}$ when it support addition or scalar(complex or real) multiplication. A subspace of a vector space is any subset of $X$ that is also a vector space. A direct sum of subspace $Y,Z$ of space $X$ if any $x \\in X $ can be written down as$$ x &#x3D; y+z \\ \\ with\\ \\ y\\in Y \\ and\\ z \\in Z$$ Example of Vector Space$Span \\ A$： Subspace Spanned by a subset $A$ of $X$Let we think more about what does it mean?let we add more hidden symbols left out. A vector space $S$ spanned by a subset $A$ of $X$ is a subspace of $X$. It is consisting of all finite linear combination of vectors of A, i.e., any vector $x \\in X$ of the form $x &#x3D; \\sum_{j\\in J}{\\alpha_j a_j}$, where the set $J$ of indices is finite, and $\\alpha_j \\in \\mathbb{K}$ and $a_j \\in A$ for all $j \\in j$. The first half sentence tells us how to write down a finite linear combination. The second half of the sentense after where ... tells us how to express the formulation in language. Such subspace is denote as: $$ Span\\ A$$ Hamel Basisa Hamel Basis in X is any family (aka. a set of) $(e_i)_{i \\in I}$ of vectors $e_i \\in X$ satisfing two properties: linearly independent. $\\sum_{j \\in J}{\\alpha_je_j&#x3D;0} &#x3D;&gt; \\alpha_j &#x3D; 0$ $Span \\ (e_i)_{i \\in I} &#x3D; X$ Example, the family $(e_n)^{\\infty}_{n&#x3D;0}$, where $e_n(x)&#x3D;x^n, x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, constitutes a Hamel basis in the space of all polynomials of one real variable. Theorem 2.1-1Let $X \\neq {0}$ be a vector space THere exists a Hamel basis of X Let $E$ and $F be two Hamel Bases of $X$ Then, $card\\ E&#x3D;card\\ F$ Chapter 3 Banach SpaceBanach spaces, i.e. , complete normed vector spaces, play a central role in linear and nonlinearfunctional analysis.","categories":[{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Math/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Funtional Analysis","slug":"Funtional-Analysis","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Funtional-Analysis/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Math","slug":"Math","permalink":"http://example.com/categories/Math/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Robotics","slug":"Robotics","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Robotics/"},{"name":"Funtional Analysis","slug":"Funtional-Analysis","permalink":"http://example.com/tags/Funtional-Analysis/"}]}
